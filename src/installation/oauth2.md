# Social login <Badge text="0.130.0+" />

Komga supports social login via **OAuth2** and **OpenID Connect**. In order for this to work, Komga needs to retrieve the user's email address via your provider, and will match it with the email of the Komga users.

In order to setup social login, you will need to create an application in the developer portal of the social login provider of your choice (Google, Facebook, Githubâ€¦), and retrieve a _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_. You will also need to configure a _Redirect URI_ in the application you created.

## Guide for common providers

### Google

Follow the instructions on the [OpenID Connect page](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect), starting in the section, "Setting up OAuth 2.0".

When asked for a "Redirect URI", use `{baseUrl}/login/oauth2/code/google`, where `baseUrl` is your server's address.

After completing the "Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials" instructions, you should have a new OAuth Client with credentials consisting of a Client ID and a Client Secret.

Modify your `application.yml` as below and replace the values in the `client-id` and `client-secret` property with the OAuth 2.0 credentials you created earlier.

Sample configuration:
```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          google:
            client-id: 1044613984fsf335-mnsdvkjy3yf98294unfmnvd8.apps.googleusercontent.com
            client-secret: jwhfkjhwefkn44t8vcxml3m
```

### Github

Register a [new application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).

For the "Authorization callback URL", use `{baseUrl}/login/oauth2/code/github`, where `baseUrl` is your server's address.

Generate a new Client Secret, you should now have a Client ID and Client Secret.

Modify your `application.yml` as below and replace the values in the `client-id` and `client-secret` property with the OAuth 2.0 credentials you created earlier.

Sample configuration:
```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          github:
            client-id: 62736jnfksui37384hnmsdnf
            client-secret: jhjgfy67363uhif762328938844940e3e8c8629c18f9
            scope: user:email
```

### Keycloak

If you run your own Keycloak install, you probably know how to setup OpenID Connect and obtain a Client ID and Client Secret.

Modify your `application.yml` as below and replace the values in the `client-id` and `client-secret` property with your credentials You will also need to update the various URIs in the `provider` section.

You need to make sure that Keyloak users have an email setup, and that it has been marked as verified.

Sample configuration:
```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          keycloak:
            client-id: your-client-id
            client-secret: c830e452-a2a9-40a0-93c1-eb84ea688245
            client-name: Keycloak
            scope: openid,email
            authorization-grant-type: authorization_code
            redirect-uri: "{baseUrl}/{action}/oauth2/code/{registrationId}"
        provider:
          keycloak:
            authorization-uri: http://localhost:8085/auth/realms/komgatest/protocol/openid-connect/auth
            token-uri: http://localhost:8085/auth/realms/komgatest/protocol/openid-connect/token
            jwk-set-uri: http://localhost:8085/auth/realms/komgatest/protocol/openid-connect/certs
            user-info-uri: http://localhost:8085/auth/realms/komgatest/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
            user-name-attribute: sub
```
